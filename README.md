### Research Experience
**Research on relationship between carbon emission and economic growth,research member**
Jul 2022 - Nov 2022

*Research on decoupling relationship and factors analysis in APEC countries*

- Analysed the Carbon decoupling in APEC over the period 1990-2019; employed the framework of the Kaya identity.
- Analyzed the long-term and short-term carbon emission factors by combining STIRPAT and the log-mean divisor index (LMDI).

*Research on relationship and forecast in Zhejiang and Anhui provinces*
- Performed the EKC test to fit the EKC of carbon emissions and economic growth.
- Analyzed the type and inflection point of the EKC curve and performed regression analysis on the data.

**Research on relationship between clean energy consumption and economic growth inthe Yangtze River urban agglomeration**
Feb 2022 - May 2022
- Validated bidirectional causal inference and redesigned a VAR model to forecast the relationship development trends.

### Project
**Student Innovation Training Program,Team Leader**
Nov 2020 - Apr 2022

*Demand-based optimization of slow Transport systems in Historic District*

- Classified potential travel crowds through the Analytic Hierarchy Process model; assigned weights to travel destinations based on crowd preference.
- Settled SP-off-RP model to measure the cost of the transportation mode; utilized RP and SP to jointly model together to obtain new parameters.
- Established the travel starting point and destination within the research scope; calculated the feasible scope of traffic travel based on the OD matrix.
- Employed the origin-to-destination path optimization within the research range through the DFS algorithm; found the shortest path.
